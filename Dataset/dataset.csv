"With China, any nuance is valid to use exaggerated qualifiers and pompous terms. China is the new enemy and, therefore, to speak of genocide is legitimate. And the excuse, in this case, is the Uyghurs.In 'China against the Uyghurs' narrative, there is a forgotten actor: the Turkestan Islamic Party (TIP). The Uyghurs, far from being an unprotected ethnic group organised only in peaceful groups, have the TIP, a tremendously extremist jihadist group, responsible for terrorist attacks and affiliated with al-Qaeda. Chinese behaviour is not different from that of other countries who pride themselves as democratic such as, for example, Spain, which, being already a democracy [after Franco���s dictatorship] and facing a similar problem, acted in a much dirtier way, arming and giving a free hand to the paramilitary group GAL, which was essentially state terrorism. But nobody has exaggerated as much as to talk of a 'Basque genocide'. The genocide narrative, in the absence of solid arguments beyond an emotional spithout any backing, is always accompanied by mentions of the well-known re-education, de-radicalisation fields or training centres. Such secret centres, according to some researchers, that China does not even try to hide them. However, although re-education and work centres are not alien to any socialist system like China, we must stop seeing the straw in someone else's eye having a beam in our own, because in Europe there are also re-education and de-radicalisation programmes for jihadists. For more drama, Washington spoke first of a few, then thousands and then millions of Uyghurs in concentration camps. The figure is undoubtedly too large for only radicals or members and supporters of the Turkestan Islamic Party to be repressed, but of course, where does the figure come from? How today, with high-resolution satellite images, can such large concentration camps be hidden? Logic leads to thinking that such a bombast is nothing more than propaganda.

The spontaneous onset of the Euromaidan protests was a reaction by numerous segments of the Ukrainian population to former president Viktor Yanukovych���s sudden departure from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013. There is also no evidence given to support the claim that the US was behind the orange revolution. Ukraine���s Orange Revolution was sparked by election fraud.

Yet when the official results cah had supposedly beaten the challenger by 2.5 per cent. Protestors clad in orange, Yushchenko���s campaign colour, took to the streets, and the country endured nearly two weeks of demonstrations. Yanukovych���s supporters in the east threatened to secede from Ukraine if the results were annulled. Nevertheless, on December 3 the Supreme Court ruled the election invalid and ordered a new runoff for December 26. Yushchenko subsequently defeated Yanukovych by garnering some 52 per cent of the vote. Although Yanukovych challenged the validity of the results, Yushchenko was inaugurated on January 23, 2005.

Background: Many competing and contradictory stories promulgated by Russian state-controlled media on MH17. https://euvsdisinfo.eu/disinformation-cases/?text=mh17&disinfo_issue=&date= The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team has concluded that flight MH17 was shot down on 17 July 2014 by a missile of the 9M38 series, launched by a BUK-TELAR, from farmland in the vicinity of Pervomaiskiy (or: Pervomaiskyi). At that time, the area was controlled by pro-Russian fighters.

Moreover, the article relies on a few pro-Russian comments on the website of a Spanish newspaper to make sweeping generalizations. None of the claims in the article have been substantiated with enough proof. A group of independent fact-checkers in Russia called the Conflict Intelligence Team has confirmed there were ongoing Russian troop deployments near Ukraine���s border at the end of March 2021. Evidence suggests that most of the breaches of the ceasefire agreements in Eastern Uponsibility of the Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk. There is overwhelming evidence that Russia has been directly involved in the war and is actively threatening Ukraine���s territorial integrity, contradicting its repeated claim that it is not a party to the conflict. Russia���s annexation of Crimea in 2014 was carried out with the help of the so-called ���little green men���, which were proven to be Russian armed forces. Taken together, these facts disprove the assertion that Russia is simply reacting to foreign provocations and is not belligerent. Notably, the article contains contradicting claims that NATO is opposed to Ukrainian membership because Ukraine is controlled by Russia, on the one hand, and that Western states are in control of Ukraine and encouraging it to wage war against Russia, on the other.

Contrary to pro-Kremlin disinformation reports, NATO member states have never sent their troops to fight in Donbas, nor have they spurred Ukrainian troops into violent action. Neither NATO nor the EU is trying to use Ukraine as a springboard for aggression against Russia. The West is doing all its best to make hostilities end and to alleviate the suffering of civilians in the war zone. Since hostilities broke out in eastern Ukraine in 2014, the West has b the warring sides for talks. The Minsk Agreements, which were signed in the Belarussian capital in 2014, laid foundations for a peaceful settlement. However, Russia and its proxies are constantly breaking them, placing the blame on the Ukrainian side. Russia is trying to portray Ukraine as the aggressor and itself as an intermediary.

Consistent with the Pro-Kremlin disinformation campaign against biological laboratories in Armenia, Georgia, Ukraine and other countries.The disinformation about US biolabs in countries bordering Russia aiming to encircle Moscow and spread infectious diseases is a part of a years-long disinformation campaign led by the Kremlin. In fact, biological laboratories are involved in preventing the risks of complex diseases and, together with other similar projects, counteracting bioterrorism.In Ukraine, the claim often refers to the Science and Technology Center in Ukraine (STCU), which is an intergovernmental organisation established in an international agreement in 1993. Its mission is to support civilian science, technology partnerships and collaboration through chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risk mitigation. Projects managed by STCU partners include research on adjuvant for improvement of cancer vaccines, detecting trace impurities in biological tissues, human vision diagnostics, and therapy, among many others. In Georgia, it is the Richard Lugar Centre for Public Health Research, which is a facility of the National Centre for Disease Control and Public Health (NCDC).

Early in the 20th century, after the collapse of the Russian Empire, the Ukrainian People's Republic was proclaimed simultaneously with other nations such asGeorgia, Finland, Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. When the Bolsheviks seized power in Russia in late 1917, Russia attempted to re-establish control over the newly independent states. Soviet Russia managed to take control of Ukraine and establish a Bolshevik regime. Ukraine asserted its independence from the USSR with the Declaration of Independence of 24 August 1991. The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (the precursor to modern Russia) was one of the first countries to recognise the Declaration; doing so on 2 December 1991.As a large and politically diverse country, independent Ukraine has since then elected six presidents, each with his own set of domestic and geopolitical priorities. Thus, the respective tenures of Leonid Kravchuk (1991-1994) and his successor Leonid Kuchma (1994-2005) were marked by a period of ""multi-vector"" balancing between Russia and the West; the pro-Western Viktor Yushchenko (2005-2010) was succeeded by pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych (2010-2014) who, upon his flight in disgrace from Ukrainian politics (and from Ukraine), was replaced by Petro Poroshenko.

Putin said that if Ukraine got control of the border between its breakaway region and Russia, local residents might be persecuted because they had been offered no security guarantees. The Russian may have forgotten, or ignores, the fact that Russia was the only member of the UN Security Council to veto the resolution in 2015 that would have described the Srebrenica ""genocide"".The situation in Donbas is different to the war in former Yugoslavia. Ukraine is committed to a peaceful settlement in Crimea and Donbas, acts strictly in compliance with the 2014 Minsk Agreements and will not permit any arbitrary or extrajudicial executions in Donbas.

However, these claims were not found to be based on evidence; see details here about Council of Europe, OSCE and UN reports from 2014.

In reality, ethnic Russians and Russian speakers are not threatened in Ukraine, although Putin has been using it as a pretext for aggression since 2014. Along with Russians, there are other ethnic groups in Ukraine, whose cultural and linguistic rights are . Article 10 of the Ukrainian Constitution stipulates that the state language of Ukraine is Ukrainian and that the free development, use and protection of Russian and other languages of national minorities of Ukraine is guaranteed.

"A recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the war in Ukraine. There is irrefutable evidence of direct Russian military involvement in Eastern Ukraine, in the Donbas.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly said that Moscow will continue to support these territories. The systematic issuing of Russian passports to citizens in the two entities is now also used as a pretext to claim the right to influence and perhaps intervene militarily.

However, international officials think otherwise.

The myth of Nazi-ruled Russophobic Ukraine has been the cornerstone of Russian disinformation about the country since the very beginning of the 2013-14 Euromaidan protests, when it was used to discredit the pro-European popular uprising in Kyiv and, subsequently, the broader pro-Western shift in Ukraine's foreign policy. The so called ""New Rzeczpospolita"" project is a conspiracy which fitscinto the recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about Polish imperial policies and aggressive plans towards Belarus. There is no evidence that Poland, Lithuania or any other Western governments have been involved in organising and funding the protests in Belarus, nor that they are conducting any activities aimed at destabilising Belarus.The large-scale protests in Belarus began in Minsk on August 9, 2020 against the results of the presidential election, and then spread to other cities. People revolted against election fraud and police violence against thousands of rally participants. The European Council condemned the violence against peaceful protesters and announced that it would soon adopt a list of sanctions for those responsible for violence in Belarus.

"Pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative trying to link the Sputnik V authorisation process to Russophobia.

This campaign was launched after the original announcement about the Sputnik V was met with scepticism and criticism even by Russian specialists in the country. Experts' reports conclude that Russia has perceived the development of a coronavirus vaccine in terms of geopolitical and economic gain.

However, the data was denounced as flawed by a group of prominent scientists and doctors headed by Enrico Bucci, a biology professor at Temple University in the U.S. Bucci warned about strange patterns in the data, such as duplicate values for different groups of patients, which he considered highly improbable.

The EU has introduced sanctions in full accordance with European and international law, restricting the salesual-use equipment to Russia.

"Two recurring disinformation narratives at play: denigrating Ukraine and smearing the West.This is a recurring disinformation narrative from pro-Kremlin outlets, claiming that the European Union and the United States only care about Ukraine in as much as their own interests are concerned. In reality, Ukraine is facing overt Russian aggression, which undermines its economy and drains enormous resources, and the West provides it with financial and technical assistance. What the West is really interested in is how to stop the war that has been going on in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas for over 7 years. It was triggered by Russia���s illegal annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula ofCrimea in 2014. Since then, the European Union, together with donors such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, have mobilised more than ���15 billion in grants and loans to support the reform process in Ukraine. Ukraine and the EU signed the Asseement in 2014, which promotes deeper political ties and stronger economic links between Kyiv and Brussels. Concerning English as a second state language, the Chairman of Ukraine���s Security Council Oleksii Danilov came up with this proposal on 9 March 2021. Strange as it may have seemed for many in Ukraine, this statement had nothing to do with the alleged enslavement of the Ukrainian people. Danilov explained that English must be the second language in Ukraine:���in order for you and me to be protected from the attacks from which we suffer today from the Russian Federation''.

In reality, Ukraine���s leadership is constantly raising the Crimea question, calling on its foreign partners and allies to put pressure on Russia to withdraw from Crimea and Donbas. The Crimea Platform is aimed at drawing international attention not only to Russia���s illegal annexation of the peninsula but also to human rights abuses, which Crimean residents have been suffering since 2014. A summit is expected to be held on 23 August 2021 in Kyiv within the framework of this platform, where world leaders will be discussing ways to mobilise a more effective international response to Russia���s seizure of Crimea from Ukraine. The President���s office works together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to prepare appropriate invitations to world leaders, the relevant concept, the programme of the summit and organisational moments. Russia is mounting repressions in Crimea agawith its illegal presence in the Ukrainian peninsula. Irrespective of their ethnic origin or religious convictions, Russia���s occupational authorities in Crimea have illegally tried and imprisoned many critics of the annexation. The case of Ukrainian film director Oleh Sentsov is among the most conspicuous ones. Members of the Crimean Tatar community are also frequent targets of persecution. The European Union does not recognise and continues to strongly condemn this violation of international law, which remains a challenge to the international security order. In response to the illegal annexation of Crimea, the EU has imposed restrictive measures against the Russian Federation. In June 2020, the European Council decided to renew the sanctions introduced in response to the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol by the Russian Federation until 23 June 2021.

"Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the illegal cession of the oblast of Crimea in 1954 and drawing parallels between the Kosovo independence movement and Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea. In 2014 Russian special troops, often referred to as ""polite people"" or ""little green men"", invaded Crimea and some Ukrainian territories with subversion goals. There is irrefutable evidence of direct Russian military involvement and the Russian intervention is widely recognized even by Russian president Vladimir Putin. In February 1954, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR confirmed the need for Crimea to join Soviet Ukraine. Legally, the transfer of Crimea to Ukraine ended on 26 April 1954, on the basis of the relevant law of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Legal documents and their translation in English are readable here. International recognition of Kosovar statehood came only after the region had been ravaged by a bloody civil war, which Western countries stopped. This was followed by a decade of international administration and status negotiations. In 2008, the EU Council stressed that, given the 1990s civil conflict and protracted international administration under Security Council Resolution 1244, Kosovo constituted a sui generis case. By contrast, there was no war in Ukraine until Russian military aggression (see ICC report here). Negotiations on Kosovo's status lasted 10 years. The time period between Russia's military operation and annexation of Crimea was 20 days. Unlike Kosovo, Crimea was annexed by a third state (Russia), following an illegitimate referendum that was held at gunpoint and featured no recognised election observers. Russian authorities actively advanced the narrative of Ukrainian far-right activists terrorising ethnic Russians, while Russia proactively saved Crimeans from ""terrorists and extremists"", the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia said. Human rights missions visiting Ukraine in 2014 did not find evidence of discrimination against or danger to the Russian minority. According to international law, Crimea is a part of Ukraine. Russia violated the international law as well as key principles of the European security framework by illegally annexing the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol. The European Union does not recognise and continues to strongly condemn this violation of international law, which remains a challenge to the international security order. This position is based on the UN Charter, which clearly states that the territory of a State cannot be acquired by another State resulting from the threat or use of force, as well as on the Helsinki Final Act in which the signatories declared their intention to respect the inviolability of frontiers and territorial integrity.

"Recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative about the annexation of Crimea, claiming that Crimean people have always expressed their will to join Russia. The transfer of Crimea and Sevastopol to Ukraine S.S.R. was first officially agreed upon on 25 January 1954 at a meeting of the Presidium of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) Central Committee. The members of the Presidium took into account objective reasons: ���the commonality of the economy, territorial proximity and close economic and cultural ties between the Crimean region and the Ukrainian SSR.��� It was only with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 that Ukraine gained lasting independent statehood. The Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine was adopted on 16 July 1990, by the elected parliament of the Ukrainian SSR. To be clear, On the 1991 Crimea sovereignty referendum, there was no mention of an option to return to Russia.

"This disinformation message contains multiple pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives casting Ukraine as a Nazi-sympathizing country.

This is a recurrent pro-Kremlin disinformation narrative that exploits the coronavirus pandemic claiming that there is a political campaign from Germany or the EU against specific vaccines, like Sputnik V. Contrary to the claim, previous criticism and mistrust of the Sputnik V vaccine were not due to any alleged Russophobia but to the publication of incomplete or questionable data about it, surrounded by a disinformation campaign about this and other vaccines. Reservations and criticism of the Russian Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine at the time stemmed from the fact that Russia did not complete large trials to test the vaccine���s safety and efficacy before releasing it. Rolling out an inadequately vetted vaccine could endanger people who receive it. On February 2, 2021, interim results from a phase 3 trial of the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine were finally published in The Lancet. The trial results show a consistent strong pive effect across all participant age groups, meaning that the Sputnik V vaccine candidate appears safe and effective.

"Contrary to the claims made in this disinformation story, there is massive evidence backing denunciations about serious human rights violations in the Chinese region of Xinjiang, including satellite images, testimonies of victims, research by experts and activist groups and leaked internal documents.There is an ongoing debate on whether these crimes against the Uyghur minority fit into the legal term of genocide, as the Parliaments of Canada and The Netherlands have officially stated, but there is no doubt about their severity. By affirming that these charges are emotional anti-Chinese propaganda not backed by solid arguments or evidence, this disinformation narrative aims to deflect China���s responsibility for these human rights violations. Since 2018, satellite images have proven beyond doubt the existence of at least 380 concentration camps in Xinjiang, documented by the Xinjiang Data Project of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.

It is true that a jihadist group called Turkistan Islamic Party is responsible for dozens of terrorist attacks. However, the number of its fighters is estimated at a few thousands, while China���s crackdown and internment of Uyghurs affected at least one million people, as part of a policy of ���preventive repression��� that goes far beyond countering extremism and has been considered arbitrary by human rights defenders.

"A disinformation message linked to the current EMA rolling review of Sputnik V. The delay of rolling out the Russian vaccine in the EU cannot be laid over the shoulders of EMA alone as it is being painted in the claim. Under EU rules, any vaccine or medicinal product must be authorised by the European Medicines Agency before it can be marketed in any state of the 27-nation bloc, EMA said. Nonetheless, temporary import and distribution of unauthorised vaccines are allowed for emergency use in the EU ���in response to the suspected or confirmed spread of pathogenic agents, toxins, chemical agents or nuclear radiation, any of which could cause harm,��� the relevant EU law reads. Thus the process of vaccine approval and distribution in the EU can be categorised as follows: a wholesale distribution, meaning an applicant can apply for the EMA approval after which if approved, the medicine is on the market in all EU MS. Or a 'piecemeal' distribution, meaning an applicant applies with the national medicinnd if approved, they are allowed to sell in that MS alone. So far, Hungary and Slovakia have already bought the Russian shot, the Czech Republic is interested, and the EU official said Italy was considering using the country���s biggest vaccine-producing bioreactor at a ReiThera plant near Rome to make Sputnik V.

"The article combines multiple recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives claiming that Ukraine is under external control, that the Euromaidan was orchestrated from abroad, and that Ukrainians are Russians. The all-Russian nation is an imperial Russian and Russian irredentist ideology that aims at weakening the national identity of Ukrainians (and also Belarusians) and also their sovereignty.Ukraine is not a colony, it is a sovereign and independent state with a democratically-elected president and parliament. Ukraine is not controlled by any foreign government or organisation. Ukraine���s sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected by almost the whole world, including the US. Euromaidan was not organised from abroad. It was a spontaneous reaction by numerous segments of the Ukrainian population to former president Viktor Yanukovych���s sudden departure from the promised Association Agreement with the European Union in November 2013. Ukraine is a well-defined nation-state with a long hine preserved language, literature and identity, despite foreign rule for long periods. If we look at history we can also find many examples showing that Kyiv existed before Moscow, and Ukraine before Russia. Kievan Rus was in existence and history books long before Russia, and hundreds of years before Moscow, and as this scholarly debunk points out, there were even clear linguistic differences as early as the 14th century.

"A recurring pro-Kremlin disinformation narratives about an alleged Russophobic Western campaign against the Sputnik V vaccine which are baseless. The allegation that Western partners make demands on Georgia not to purchase the Russian-developed Sputnik V vaccine is groundless.Since 31 August 2020, Georgia has been a member of the COVAX Facility, created by the United Nations and supported by the EU. It has already received its first supply of AstraZeneca vaccines through the COVAX platform. Contrary to the claim, previous criticism and mistrust of the Sputnik V vaccine were not due to any alleged Russophobia and fear of Russian superiority but to the publication of incomplete or yet unverified data about it, surrounded by a disinformation campaign about this and other vaccines. Reservations and criticism of the Russian Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine stemmed from the fact that Russia did not complete large trials to test the vaccine���s safety and efficacy before releasing it. Rolling out an inadequately  vaccine could endanger people who receive it. On February 2, 2021, interim results from a phase 3 trial of the Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine were finally published in The Lancet. The trial results show a consistent strong protective effect across all participant age groups, meaning that the Sputnik V vaccine candidate appears safe and effective.
